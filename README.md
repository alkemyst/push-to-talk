# A push-to-talk mechanism for zoom

The present script switches the microphone of zoom on or off.
At the same time it enables/disables the audio feedback from the microphone to the standard speaker, assuming that it's headphones we have plugged in.
This should allow users to understand if they are spamming noise into the mic, if they are saturating, etc.

The script to launch (PTT) should be put manually in your bin directory, and it should be modified so as to point to the correct installation directory

## The audio monitor
`pacatMonitor` is really customized to my own system, so please check how it can be made to work for you.
